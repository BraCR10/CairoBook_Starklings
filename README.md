# Learning Cairo Programming Language

Welcome to my repository where I am documenting my journey learning the Cairo programming language. Cairo is a language designed to work with the StarkNet blockchain, which enables the development of scalable decentralized applications (dApps).

This repository contains my progress, notes, exercises, and solutions as I follow the Cairo Book and Starklings tutorials.

## About Cairo

Cairo is a Turing-complete programming language developed by StarkWare to write smart contracts for the StarkNet blockchain. It is based on the concept of STARKs (Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge) to provide scalability and security to decentralized applications.

Cairo aims to deliver an efficient and scalable way of executing smart contracts on StarkNet, which is important for blockchain applications that need to handle a large number of transactions without compromising on performance.

## Learning Resources

### Cairo Book

The [Cairo Book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/) is the official documentation and tutorial to help you learn Cairo . It covers everything from the basics of Cairo to more advanced topics like writing and deploying smart contracts on StarkNet.

I am going through the Cairo Book to understand core concepts, syntax, and best practices for building decentralized applications on StarkNet.

### Starklings

[Starklings](https://starklings.cairo-lang.org/) is an interactive set of tutorials designed to help beginners get familiar with Cairo programming. The exercises cover key areas of Cairo, providing a hands-on approach to learning the language through coding challenges.

I am following Starklings as a way to solidify my understanding and gain practical experience by solving real-world problems.

## Learning Progress

In this repository, you will find:

- Solutions to exercises from the Cairo Book and Starklings
- Code samples 
- Personal thoughts and challenges faced during the learning process

This section will be updated regularly as I progress through the materials.
